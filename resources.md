These notes are aimed at teachers and guides intending to give a talk on Nicolas Poussin’s _Extreme Unction_. For teachers, they will be of use in a range of subjects including Art, History, Religious Studies, History of Art and Classical Civilisation. These resources are predominantly aimed at secondary school teachers but could also be useful to KS2 primary school teachers.
